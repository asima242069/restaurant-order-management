## Requirements

To run the project on your computer, the following must be installed:

- Java 8 or higher.
- PostgreSQL.
- JDBC driver for PostgreSQL.

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/restaurant-order-management.git
   cd restaurant-order-management
   ```

Make sure PostgreSQL is installed and the database with the required structure is created. If the database hasnâ€™t been created yet, run the following SQL queries to create the tables:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    user_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    email VARCHAR(100),
    role VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE dishes (
    dish_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    category VARCHAR(50),
    price DECIMAL(10, 2),
    available BOOLEAN
);

CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT,
    dish_id INT,
    quantity INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(user_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (dish_id) REFERENCES dishes(dish_id)
);

CREATE TABLE transactions (
    transaction_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT,
    total_amount DECIMAL(10, 2),
    quantity INT,
    transaction_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(user_id)
);
```

Add sample data to the `users` and `dishes` tables (for testing). Example data for the `dishes` table:

```sql
INSERT INTO dishes (name, category, price, available) VALUES
('Pasta Carbonara', 'Italian', 33.43, FALSE),
('Pizza Margherita', 'Italian', 20.71, TRUE),
('Caesar Salad', 'Salad', 43.16, FALSE),
('Chicken Curry', 'Indian', 9.44, FALSE),
('Vegetable Stir Fry', 'Chinese', 37.78, TRUE);
```

Compile and run the project.

## Example Usage
- Log in as a user or an administrator.
  - For users:
    - View available dishes.
    - Place an order by selecting a dish and specifying the quantity.
  - For administrators:
    - View statistics on orders and dishes.
    - Add, update, or delete dishes.

## Important Notes
- Login is done by user ID.
- The administrator must enter a password to access the admin menu.
- When placing an order, an entry is made in the `orders` table, and a transaction is recorded in the `transactions` table.
